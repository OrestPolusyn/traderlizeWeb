          Tradelize is a completely transparent and secure ecosystem with which you manage your assets on the crypto market. Only you have access to your funds. Your crypto remains untouchable, and you keep it on your favorite exchanges. Tradelize only requires the ability to read data and make trades, so your funds can't be withdrawn from the exchanges.
        </p>

        <p class="side-content__content content">
          Tradelize was built with your security in mind from the beginning. Every API key is securely encrypted. We use modern SHA-256 encryption algorithms. Entering APIs is protected by encryption and is shared only with the exchanges.
